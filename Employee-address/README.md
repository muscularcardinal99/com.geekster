# Employee Address

This is a software development task involving the creation of two entity classes, Employee and Address, with corresponding attributes. The Employee entity class is annotated with @OneToOne to create a one-to-one mapping with the Address class. Additionally, two controller classes, EmployeeController and AddressController, are created to handle CRUD operations for these entities. The endpoints defined include GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods to enable data retrieval and manipulation.


## DataFlowStructure
in the following Java Program  

~~~
1.AddressController
  1.getAllAddress()
  2.getAddressById(@PathVariable Long id)
  3.addAddress(@RequestBody Address address)
  4.upDateAddressById(@PathVariable Long id,@RequestBody Address address)
  5.deleteById(@PathVariable Long id)
2.AddressServices
  1.getAllAddress()
  2.getById(Long id)
  3.addAddress(Address address)
  4.updateByAddress(Long id, Address address)
  5.deleteById(Long id)
3.IAddressRepo
  1.getAll()
  2.updateCity(String city,Long id);
  3.updateState(String state, Long id);
  4.updateStreet(String street, Long id);
  5.updateZipCode(String zipCode, Long id);
4.EmployeeController
  1.getAllEmployee()
  2.getEmployee(@PathVariable Long id)
  3.addEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee)
  4.updateEmployee(@PathVariable Long id ,@RequestBody Employee employee)
  5.deleteEmployeeById(@PathVariable Long id)
5.EmployeeService
  1.getAllEmployee()
  2.findEmployeeById(Long id)
  3.addEmployeeData(Employee employee)
  4.updateEmployee(Long id, Employee employee) 
  5.deleteEmployee(Long id)
6.IEmployeeRepo
  1.updateFirstName(String firstName, Long id)
  2.updateLastName(String lastName, Long id)
  3.getEmployee(Long id)
  4.getAllEmployee()
7.Model/DataBase Design
  1.This class contains Address and Employee Model and its Properties
