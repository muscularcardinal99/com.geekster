# Random jokes joke using data source 
Description of Java Project: Random Jokes using an Exposed API

This Java project aims to entertain users by fetching and displaying random jokes from an exposed API. The project utilizes the power of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve jokes and provide a lighthearted experience to users.

Here's a brief description of how the project works:

1. User Interface: The project includes a user interface, which can be a console-based application or a graphical user interface (GUI) depending on the implementation. The interface allows users to interact with the program and receive random jokes.

2. API Integration: The project integrates an exposed API that offers a collection of random jokes. This API exposes endpoints or methods that can be accessed to retrieve a joke or a set of jokes.

3. HTTP Requests: The Java project uses HTTP requests, specifically GET requests, to communicate with the API. It sends a request to the specified URL of the API endpoint to retrieve a random joke.

4. JSON Parsing: After receiving the response from the API, the project parses the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data to extract the relevant information, such as the joke itself, from the API response. JSON parsing libraries in Java, such as Gson or Jackson, can be used to simplify this process.

5. Displaying the Joke: Once the joke is extracted from the API response, the project displays it to the user through the user interface. The joke can be printed to the console or shown in a pop-up window, depending on the UI implementation.

6. Error Handling: The project includes error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios where the API is unreachable or the response is invalid. This ensures a smooth user experience even in case of unexpected errors.

Overall, this Java project aims to provide an interactive and amusing experience for users by fetching and displaying random jokes obtained from an exposed API.
